# MQ-ACM

## General

**Beginners should start with:**

- [Codingbat](https://codingbat.com/)

**After you have completed substantial amount of Codingbat and feel confident:**

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

**Ready for REAL problems:**

- Learn to use Scanner (or any other input reader)
    - [Scanner Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html)

- Examples for using Java Scanner
    - Have a look at "Scanner Examples" directory
        - Haven't created example inputs yet (will soon)

- [Problems curated by Daniel](http://www.mqacm.ninja/problems)
    - You will submit the solutions on this site: [OnlineJudge](https://onlinejudge.org/)
        - This is essentially the final destination where you will progress to harder problems on this site after completing the curated problems on Daniel's site.
        - Talk to Daniel/Jesse to get added on to the leaderboard.

- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)
    - This is a backup option incase OnlineJudge doesn't work unexpectedly.

**NOT REQUIRED BUT RECOMMENDED**

- Look into Git and creating a Github account. Will allow you to work remotely and version control is very important in the future. Think of it as Google Drive where you store your files in "Repositories" and provides an easy way to continue work remotely from any computer (as long as Git is installed).
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    - You can use the GUI but I really recommend trying to use the CLI as it just makes everything so much faster. 
    - [Linux CLI Tutorial](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)
        - You just need to know how to navigate around your directories.
        - Please note that Git Bash is emulating bash shell and some commands may not be available.
            - File system is in Windows so it will be different.

- Using Java in the Command Line Inteface
    - I recommend learning CLI because it will create a faster workflow when developing.
    - [Java CLI in Windows](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/windows-cmd.html)
        - You can just google it if that link doesn't work. Otherwise ask around (at meetups).
