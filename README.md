# MQ-ACM

## General

Beginners should start with:

- [Codingbat](https://codingbat.com/)

After you have completed substantial amount of Codingbat and feel confident:

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

Ready for REAL problems:

- Learn to use Scanner (or any other input reader)
    - [Scanner Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html)

- Examples for using Java Scanner
    - Have a look at "Scanner Examples" directory
        - Haven't created example inputs yet (will soon)

- [Problems curated by Daniel](http://www.mqacm.ninja/problems)
    - You will submit the solutions on this site: [OnlineJudge](https://onlinejudge.org/)
        - This is essentially the final destination where you will progress to harder problems on this site after completing the curated problems on Daniel's site.
        - Talk to Daniel/Jesse to get added on to the leaderboard.

- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)
    - This is a backup option incase OnlineJudge doesn't work unexpectedly.
